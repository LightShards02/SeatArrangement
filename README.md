# SeatArrangement
Iâ€™m Kevin, a high school student from Wuhan, China. My class has a tradition of changing seats on a regular basis. However, arranging seats in a scientific method is a complex task, for there different requirements from different classmates, such as being the desk mates with a student or sitting in the front. Thus, I made this program to make this process easier.

This program is a graphical user interface developed based on Java Swing. It mainly achieves two functions: 1)read .csv file and write in .csv file 2)generate a random 2D array(the seat chart) based on specific requirements. It will first ask the user to input different kinds of requirements from students. Then, the program will generate a seat chart based on the input requirements.
